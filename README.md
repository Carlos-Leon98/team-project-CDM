# WI State Parks RESTful Web Service Project

## Overview
- Many people travel to Wisconsin to experience the natural scenic beauty it has to offer. It can be difficult to
locate and then find information about the State Parks, Forests and Recreation Areas throughout the state. People may
be left searching through many different websites, or hoping to find a booklet at a small gas station when they get
close to their destination. Often times the Parks, Forests and Recreation areas are listed in different areas as well,
leading to only some places being found while other places nearby are overlooked. This web service will provide
information about different State Forests, Parks, and Recreation Areas in a chosen county.
