# User Guide

Welcome! Our State Parks API can be used for any project looking to display information for Wisconsin State Parks. You can use this service for displaying information about all parks in Wisconsin, parks in a given county, or for returning information about camping and hiking at different parks. Below we have listed the different service calls, and database schema information.

You can get the information returned as JSON data or as plain text data, just by modifying your service call. This allows you to use the returned information in many different ways.
